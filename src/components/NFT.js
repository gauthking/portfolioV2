                    <h3>MicropuppiesNFT - First OpenSea NFT Project</h3>
                    <p>This is my first NFT Collection and it is live in the OpenSea NFT
                        MarketPlace. I created 500 unique Pixel Puppy art using different
                        art components ( body, background, sunglasses, bowties, hats). For
                        minting them I made a python code using PyAutoGUI python library
                        to initialize a GUI Automation and mint 500 NFTs in the
                        Marketplace. The code was able to upload all the NFTs to the
                        marketplace despite of some connectivity issues that happened once
                        or twice there were no other issues.</p>
