                    Hello. I'm Gautham Krishhna and I am a first year undergrad studying
                    at VIT University. I love to code and I'm super passionate about web
                    development and design. I'm familiar with REACTJS and have build many apps with it, I find it really helpful in the frontend part.
                    For a full-stack web app I personally like working with MERN stack.<br />
                    I'm also into UI/UX and have experience in working with UI/UX Apps
                    like Figma and even Photoshop. <br />
                    I also love Content-Creation, Video Editing, Filmmaking and
                    Photography. <br />
                    And yeah, I'm into Blockchain, Web3, Smart Contract development
                    technologies which is a "hot cake" nowadays. Currenly exploring and
                    learning about Ethereum Ecosystem and Solidity language for building smart contracts and decentralised applications. I have also built few dApps or decentralised Apps which is showcased in the projects page of this portfolio.<br />
                    As a Computer Science undergrad, I'm super interested in learning
                    coding languages. I'm pretty comfortable with Python, C and C++.
