                    <p>First full stack web app made with REACT (frontend) and the
                        backend functionalites like authentication, realtime database and
                        payment features were implemented using FIREBASE and STRIPE (for
                        payments). The final version of the app allows the payment and
                        realtime functionality feature but it has not deployed yet due to
                        FIREBASE's BLAZE plan upgradation which has not been done yet :( .
                        The version before has been deployed and it can be viewed.</p>

                    <p>This tinder clone is built using the MERN stack and Firebase for authentication purposes. I have also made the use of Firestore to store additional user info and for displaying them in the USER info part of the App. MongoDB is used here to pull the information of the datesüíù that is stored in the project collection. This is just a basic MERN stack build. More features coming soon. The Repository link is only for the frontend app. The backend is deployed using Heroku and has not been pushed into GitHub.</p>

                        is hosted temporarily on netlify app. More developments to be
                        added soon. Most site features are still static since I focussed
                        more on the styling part, it has little bit of JS too. You can get
